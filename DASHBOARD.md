# Dashboard Guide

This document provides information about the dashboards available in the API Observability Platform and how to use them effectively.

## Dashboard Philosophy

Effective dashboards serve specific purposes and answer key questions. Our dashboard approach follows these principles:

- **Purpose-driven design**: Each dashboard answers specific questions
- **Information hierarchy**: Most important metrics are immediately visible
- **Cognitive efficiency**: Related metrics are grouped for easier comprehension
- **Progressive disclosure**: Start with high-level information, then drill down
- **Consistent visual language**: Similar metrics use similar visualizations

These principles ensure that dashboards provide actionable insights quickly and efficiently.

## Overview

The API Observability Platform comes with pre-configured dashboards that provide insights into various aspects of the system. These dashboards are built using Grafana and leverage data from Prometheus, Elasticsearch, and Jaeger.

### Dashboard Design Principles

Our dashboards follow specific design principles:

1. **The 5-Second Rule**: The most important information can be understood in 5 seconds
2. **Focus on Outliers**: Visual emphasis on abnormal values and patterns
3. **Context Through Comparison**: Current metrics shown alongside historical patterns
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Critical metrics receive visual prominence
5. **Consistent Layouts**: Predictable organization aids in quick interpretation

These principles make dashboards immediately useful in both normal operations and incident response.

### Accessing Dashboards

To access the dashboards:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Log in with your Grafana credentials (default: admin/admin)
3. Click on the "Dashboards" menu and select "Browse"
4. Choose one of the pre-configured dashboards from the list

## Dashboard Types

The platform includes several types of dashboards:

1. **API Service Dashboard**: Monitors API endpoint performance and usage
2. **System Dashboard**: Tracks system-level metrics like CPU, memory, and disk usage
3. **Database Dashboard**: Provides insights into database performance and connections
4. **Business Metrics Dashboard**: Displays business-related metrics specific to your application
5. **Error Analysis Dashboard**: Helps identify and troubleshoot errors

## API Service Dashboard

The API Service Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the API's performance and usage patterns.

### Dashboard Intent

This dashboard answers these critical questions:
- Is the API functioning properly right now?
- Where are users experiencing slowness or errors?
- Which endpoints require optimization?
- Are there unusual traffic patterns to investigate?

### Key Panels

#### Request Rate

![Request Rate](images/request_rate.png)

This panel shows the rate of incoming requests over time, broken down by endpoint:

- **Metrics Used**: `rate(http_requests_total[5m])`
- **Visualization**: Line graph
- **Use Case**: Monitor traffic patterns and identify unusual spikes or drops

#### Response Time

![Response Time](images/response_time.png)

This panel displays the response time distribution for API endpoints:

- **Metrics Used**: `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, endpoint))`
- **Visualization**: Heatmap

### Using the API Service Dashboard

To get the most out of this dashboard:

1. **Time Range Selection**: Adjust the time range in the top-right corner to view data for different periods
2. **Filtering**: Use the endpoint and status filters to focus on specific areas
3. **Drill Down**: Click on a spike or anomaly to zoom in and investigate
   - **Pro Tip**: Use split view to compare different time periods side-by-side

4. **Common Investigation Paths**:
   - Error rate increase → Check error distribution → Examine recent errors
   - Latency spike → Check system metrics → Review database queries
   - Traffic anomaly → Check user distribution → Look for pattern changes

## Dashboard Psychology

Understanding how humans process visual information is crucial for effective dashboards:

### Cognitive Load Optimization

Our dashboards use these techniques to reduce cognitive load:

1. **Consistent Color Coding**: Red for errors/problems, green for healthy states
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Visualizations that highlight deviations from normal
3. **Spatial Memory**: Consistent panel placement for faster information location
4. **Reduction of Visual Noise**: Only displaying essential information
5. **Preattentive Processing**: Using size, color, and position to highlight importance

### Dashboard Reading Patterns

Dashboards are designed around how people naturally scan information:

1. **F-Pattern Reading**: Most important metrics positioned in the top and left
2. **Guided Attention**: Visual hierarchy directs focus to critical elements
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Details available on demand, not overwhelming initially
4. **Context Preservation**: Related information kept together

### Avoiding Common Dashboard Pitfalls

Our dashboards avoid these common problems:

1. **Vanity Metrics**: Every metric displayed has actionable value
2. **Data Without Context**: Metrics include historical comparison and thresholds
3. **Misleading Visualizations**: Appropriate chart types for each data type
4. **Over-aggregation**: Ability to drill down into more granular data

## Dashboard Best Practices

1. **Focus on Actionability**: Each dashboard should help answer specific questions
2. **Consistent Layout**: Use a consistent layout and organization across dashboards
3. **Use Appropriate Visualizations**: Choose visualizations that best represent the data
4. **Add Documentation**: Include descriptions for panels and dashboards
5. **Set Appropriate Time Ranges**: Configure default time ranges that make sense for the data
6. **Use Variables**: Leverage template variables for flexible filtering
7. **Consider Performance**: Avoid too many complex queries on a single dashboard
8. **Include Context**: Add external links to relevant documentation or runbooks

## Future Dashboard Enhancements

The dashboard roadmap includes:

1. **AI-assisted anomaly detection**: Automated highlighting of unusual patterns
2. **Business impact correlation**: Connecting technical metrics to business outcomes
3. **Personalized dashboards**: Customized views based on user roles and preferences
4. **Predictive visualizations**: Forecast trends based on historical patterns
5. **Dashboard analytics**: Understanding which metrics are most valuable during incidents

By continuously improving our dashboards, we ensure they remain effective tools for monitoring and troubleshooting.
