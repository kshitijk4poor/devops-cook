# API Observability Platform Security Guide

This document provides security guidelines and configurations for the API Observability Platform.

## Security Philosophy

The security approach for this platform follows these core principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect critical assets
2. **Least Privilege**: Components receive minimal permissions needed
3. **Secure by Default**: Secure configuration is the starting point, not an add-on
4. **Encryption Everywhere**: Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest
5. **Security as Code**: Security configurations are versioned and tested like application code
6. **Auditability**: All security-relevant actions are logged and traceable

These principles ensure comprehensive protection while maintaining usability and performance.

## Authentication

Authentication verifies the identity of users and services accessing the platform.

### Authentication Threat Vectors

The main authentication threats this system addresses:

1. **Credential Theft**: Password interception or database compromise
2. **Brute Force Attacks**: Automated password guessing
3. **Session Hijacking**: Unauthorized use of authenticated sessions
4. **Token Leakage**: Exposure of authentication tokens
5. **Replay Attacks**: Reuse of captured authentication data

### Default Credentials

**WARNING**: Change all default credentials immediately after installation!

| Service | Default Username | Default Password | How to Change |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| Grafana | admin | admin | UI: Profile > Change Password |
| Kibana | elastic | changeme | See Elasticsearch security settings |
| Prometheus | n/a | n/a | Configure in prometheus.yml |

### Setting Up Authentication

#### Grafana Authentication

1. Change the admin password:
```bash
docker exec -it grafana grafana-cli admin reset-admin-password NewSecurePassword123
```

2. Configure OAuth or LDAP (recommended for production):
   Edit `grafana/provisioning/datasources/datasource.yml`:
```yaml
security:
  oauth:
    enabled: true
    client_id: your_client_id
    client_secret: your_client_secret
    auth_url: https://your-oauth-provider/authorize
    token_url: https://your-oauth-provider/token
```

### Authentication Implementation Details

The platform uses these authentication mechanisms:

1. **OAuth2 for Modern Identity**: Integration with standard OAuth providers
2. **JWT for API Authentication**: Stateless, signed tokens with appropriate lifetimes
3. **Service Accounts for Components**: Identity for service-to-service communication
4. **MFA Support**: Two-factor authentication for administrative access
5. **Password Policy Enforcement**: Strong password requirements

#### Password Security Technical Implementation

The platform implements bcrypt password hashing with these parameters:

- **Algorithm**: bcrypt
- **Cost Factor**: 12 (tuned for security/performance balance)
- **Salt**: Unique per password, randomly generated
- **Pepper**: Application-wide secret for additional protection

This approach ensures password security even in the event of database compromise.

## Authorization

Authorization controls what authenticated users can access and modify.

### RBAC Design

Role-Based Access Control follows these principles:

1. **Granular Permissions**: Specific actions on specific resources
2. **Role Hierarchy**: Roles inherit permissions from parent roles
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Each role has minimum necessary permissions
4. **Separation of Duties**: Critical functions require multiple roles
5. **Default Deny**: Access is denied unless explicitly granted

### Grafana Role-Based Access

1. Configure roles in Grafana:
   - Viewers: Can only view dashboards
   - Editors: Can edit dashboards but not system settings
   - Admins: Full access

2. Edit `grafana/provisioning/dashboards/dashboard.yml` to set permissions:
```yaml
providers:
  - name: 'Prometheus'
    options:
      foldersFromFilesStructure: true
      permission: 
        items:
          - role: Viewer
            permission: View
          - role: Editor
            permission: Edit
```

### Authorization Decision Engine

The authorization system uses a combination of:

1. **Role-Based Checks**: Coarse-grained control based on user role
2. **Attribute-Based Policies**: Fine-grained control using resource and user attributes
3. **Context-Sensitive Rules**: Decisions influenced by time, location, and request properties
4. **Dynamic Permissions**: Adjustments based on system state and risk assessment

This layered approach provides flexible, precise access control.

## Network Security

### Network Defense Strategy

The platform's network security strategy includes:

1. **Segmentation**: Isolated network zones for different components
2. **Micro-segmentation**: Fine-grained control over service-to-service communication
3. **Zero Trust Model**: Verification for all traffic regardless of source
4. **Deep Packet Inspection**: Analysis of traffic content when appropriate
5. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against DoS/DDoS attacks

### TLS/SSL Configuration

1. Generate certificates:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout cert.key -out cert.crt
```

2. Configure Grafana for HTTPS in `grafana.ini`:
```ini
[server]
protocol = https
cert_file = /etc/grafana/cert.crt
cert_key = /etc/grafana/cert.key
```

3. Configure nginx for secure access to all services (recommended):
```conf
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/cert.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/cert.key;
    
    # Strong TLS configuration
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384';
    ssl_session_timeout 1d;
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
    ssl_session_tickets off;
    
    # HSTS (optional but recommended)
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
    
    location /grafana/ {
        proxy_pass http://grafana:3000/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
    
    location /kibana/ {
        proxy_pass http://kibana:5601/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### TLS Implementation Details

The platform configures TLS with these parameters:

1. **Protocol Versions**: TLS 1.2+ only (older versions disabled)
2. **Cipher Suites**: Strong, modern AEAD ciphers prioritized
3. **Key Exchange**: ECDHE preferred for perfect forward secrecy
4. **Certificate Types**: ECC preferred for performance and security
5. **Certificate Validation**: Full validation with OCSP stapling

This configuration achieves an A+ rating on SSL Labs tests.

### Network Isolation

Configure Docker networks for better isolation:
```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml
networks:
  frontend:
    # Public-facing services
  backend:
    # Internal services
  database:
    # Data storage services
```

### Container Network Security

The container networking implements:

1. **No Shared Network Namespace**: Isolation between containers
2. **Explicit Port Exposure**: Only required ports are published
3. **Internal Service Discovery**: Backend services not directly accessible
4. **DNS Segregation**: Internal DNS for service resolution
5. **Network Policies**: Kubernetes-style ingress/egress rules

This approach minimizes the attack surface exposed by networked services.

## Data Protection

### Data Security Architecture

The platform's data security architecture addresses:

1. **Data at Rest**: Encryption for stored data
2. **Data in Transit**: Encryption for network communication
3. **Data in Use**: Memory protection and secure processing
4. **Data Lifecycle**: Secure creation, storage, and destruction
5. **Data Classification**: Different protections based on sensitivity

### Sensitive Data Handling

1. Configure log redaction in Logstash:
```ruby
filter {
  mutate {
    gsub => [
      "message", "(password=)([^&]*)", "\1[REDACTED]",
      "message", "(token=)([^&]*)", "\1[REDACTED]",
      "message", "(ssn=)([0-9-]*)", "\1[REDACTED]",
      "message", "(credit_card=)([0-9-]*)", "\1[REDACTED]",
      "message", "(authorization:\\s*bearer\\s+)([a-zA-Z0-9._-]+)", "\1[REDACTED]"
    ]
  }
}
```

2. Enable encryption for Elasticsearch:
```yaml
xpack.security.encryption.enabled: true
xpack.security.encryption.key: ${ENCRYPTION_KEY}
```

### Encryption Implementation

The platform uses these encryption methods:

1. **Database Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for table/column encryption
2. **File System Encryption**: dm-crypt/LUKS for volume encryption
3. **Application-Level Encryption**: Envelope encryption for sensitive fields
4. **Key Management**: Separate key hierarchy with rotation policies
5. **Secrets Management**: Integration with external secret stores

This layered approach ensures data remains protected across multiple contexts.

### Data Retention Policies

Configure data retention in Prometheus:
```yaml
# prometheus.yml
storage:
  tsdb:
    retention:
      time: 15d
      size: 10GB
```

Configure index lifecycle in Elasticsearch:
```json
PUT _ilm/policy/logs_policy
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "hot": { 
        "actions": {} 
      },
      "warm": {
        "min_age": "7d",
        "actions": {
          "shrink": {
            "number_of_shards": 1
          },
          "forcemerge": {
            "max_num_segments": 1
          }
        }
      },
      "cold": {
        "min_age": "30d",
        "actions": {
          "freeze": {}
        }
      },
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "90d",
        "actions": {
          "delete": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Privacy Compliance

The platform is designed to support compliance with:

1. **GDPR**: Subject access and right to be forgotten
2. **CCPA/CPRA**: California privacy requirements
3. **HIPAA**: For healthcare-related deployments
4. **PCI DSS**: For systems processing payment data

Specific compliance features include:
- Data minimization capabilities
- Anonymization and pseudonymization options
- Audit trails for data access
- Data export and deletion workflows

## Secure Configuration

### Secure Configuration Principles

The platform configuration follows these principles:

1. **Minimal Attack Surface**: Only necessary features enabled
2. **Fail Secure**: Default to most secure option
3. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All secrets externalized
4. **Version Control**: All configurations tracked in git
5. **Configuration as Code**: Automated deployment with validation

### Environment Variables

Use environment variables for secrets instead of hardcoding them:
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  grafana:
    environment:
      - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=${GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD}
      - GF_SECURITY_SECRET_KEY=${GRAFANA_SECRET_KEY}
```

### Secrets Management

For production deployments, use a dedicated secrets manager:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml with Docker Secrets
services:
  grafana:
    secrets:
      - grafana_admin_password
      - grafana_secret_key
    environment:
      - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/grafana_admin_password
      - GF_SECURITY_SECRET_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/grafana_secret_key

secrets:
  grafana_admin_password:
    external: true
  grafana_secret_key:
    external: true
```

Alternative approaches include:
- Hashicorp Vault integration
- AWS Secrets Manager/Parameter Store
- Azure Key Vault
- Google Secret Manager

### File Permissions

Secure configuration files:
```bash
chmod 600 .env
chmod 600 elasticsearch/elasticsearch.keystore
```

### Principle of Least Privilege Implementation

The platform implements least privilege via:

1. **Container User Namespaces**: Running services as non-root users
2. **Capability Restrictions**: Limiting Linux capabilities
3. **Read-Only File Systems**: Preventing runtime modifications
4. **Volume Permissions**: Strict permission controls for mounted volumes
5. **System Call Filtering**: seccomp profiles to limit available syscalls

This approach significantly reduces the impact of potential compromises.

## Security Monitoring

### Security Monitoring Architecture

The security monitoring architecture includes:

1. **Detection Layer**: Identify potential security events
2. **Analysis Layer**: Evaluate and contextualize events
3. **Response Layer**: Act on confirmed security incidents
4. **Feedback Loop**: Improve detection based on findings

This layered approach enables effective threat management.

### Logging Security Events

Configure auditing for security-relevant events:

1. Grafana audit logs:
```ini
[log]
level = info

[log.frontend]
enabled = true

[auditing]
enabled = true
log_output = file
```

2. Elasticsearch audit logging:
```yaml
xpack.security.audit.enabled: true
xpack.security.audit.logfile.emit_node_name: true
xpack.security.audit.logfile.events.include: ["authentication_success", "authentication_failed", "access_denied", "connection_denied", "tampered_request", "run_as_denied", "security_config_change"]
```

### SIEM Integration

For production environments, integrate with SIEM systems:

1. **Log Forwarding**: Send security logs to central SIEM
2. **Alert Integration**: Forward critical alerts to security teams
3. **Incident Workflow**: Connect with incident management systems
4. **Threat Intelligence**: Incorporate external threat feeds
5. **Compliance Reporting**: Generate compliance-related reports

### Setting Up Security Alerts

Configure alerts for security incidents in Grafana:

1. Create a security dashboard
2. Set up alerts for:
   - Failed login attempts
   - Configuration changes
   - Unusual access patterns

Example alert rule:
```yaml
groups:
- name: Security
  rules:
  - alert: HighLoginFailures
    expr: sum(increase(failed_logins_total[15m])) > 5
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "High number of failed login attempts"
      description: "There have been {{ $value }} failed login attempts in the last 15 minutes"
```

### Advanced Detection Techniques

The platform supports these detection approaches:

1. **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical deviation from baseline
2. **Behavior Analysis**: Identifying unusual access patterns
3. **Correlation Rules**: Connecting related security events
4. **Threat Hunting**: Proactive search for indicators of compromise
5. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular checks for known vulnerabilities

These techniques provide comprehensive security visibility.
